Step 1: 
Upload files in the zip files.
Step 2:
perform data cleaning like removing nulls and making sure the data is consistent in type.
Step 3:
Perform some EDA to check for some skewed data.
Step 4:
split the data set in to training and testing data set. 
Step 5:
Build the model using linear and logestic regression model. 
Step 6:
Validate the model using some external data.
